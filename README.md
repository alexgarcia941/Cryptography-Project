## Project Description

This project implements several cryptographic algorithms and protocols, including:
- **Keccak**: Specifically the core keccak512 algorithm. 
- **KMACXOF256**: A SHA-3 derived function that provides keyed message authentication with extendable output.
- **SHAKE256**: A cryptographic hash function with extendable output length.
- **Ed448-Goldilocks curve**: An Edwards curve used for elliptic curve cryptography, providing high security and performance.
- **DHIES encryption**: Diffie-Hellman Integrated Encryption Scheme, which combines public-key and symmetric-key cryptography.
- **Schnorr signatures**: A digital signature scheme based on elliptic curves, known for its simplicity and security.

## Features
